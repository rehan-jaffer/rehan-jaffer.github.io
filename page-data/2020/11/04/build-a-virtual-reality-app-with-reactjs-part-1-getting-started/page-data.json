What about Virtual Reality ones? React Three Fiber is an interface to the popular ThreeJS library that allows building 3D graphics in web applications using familiar idioms. ReactXR extends React Three Fiber to WebXR, the standard for interacting with the web from VR devices like the Oculus Rift/Quest and Gear VR. In this article we’ll be building a simple clone of MS Paint using Javascript and ReactXR.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"has-large-font-size\"><strong>What you’ll need</strong></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>You don’t actually need a VR device to follow along with this, but it really helps. The WebXR extension for Chrome allows you to test VR code in the browser (see picture) which is useful for debugging but doesn’t give you the full feel of testing our your creation. I built this example using the Oculus Quest 2, but I’m sure it’d be possible to develop some interesting applications using something as simple as Google Cardboard.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"has-large-font-size\"><strong>Getting Started</strong></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Let’s create a new project with create-react-app.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Now we’ll add the dependencies.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>And the boilerplate.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"has-large-font-size\"><strong>Working with ReactXR</strong></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Since R3F uses familiar syntax, if you’re used to working with hooks you’ll be at home here.
